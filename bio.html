        <p>
            I was a Boy Scout for many years and have worked at Camp Phillips as an aquatics instructor and
            lifeguard. I have also worked with many different companies from food service to labor, and even a few
            communication based jobs. My father used to own a construction company, So I ended up working with
            him before I got into high school. From there, I ended up in a burger king, a papa murphys, a political
            call center and a boy scout camp, with random side jobs here and there.
