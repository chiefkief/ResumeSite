    <h1>Project: Home Server Revival</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        I purchased a used MacBook on Craigslist for schoolwork, but its age and noise issues led me to rely on school computers instead. 
        After discovering a Linus Tech Tips video on turning old computers into home servers, I decided to breathe new life into my MacBook.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        I aimed to explore the possibilities of repurposing my old MacBook, even if it meant it might break and return to its dormant state. I also wanted to find a convenient way to access my extensive movie and book collections without cluttering my devices.
    </p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        Inspired by the LTT video, I opted to use Ubuntu-Server instead of Windows, leveraging my existing experience with Ubuntu and the Linux command line. I discovered Docker's potential while setting up a Jellyfin server and added more containers to the server. However, managing pages without Docker proved challenging, so I created an Apache page to provide easy access to all installed server elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        Through this project, I discovered the versatility of home servers and have continued to experiment with new features. My server now runs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Jellyfin for movie management</li>
        <li>Kavita Reader for ebook management</li>
        <li>NextCloud for file storage and backup</li>
        <li>Portainer for container management</li>
        <li>A navigation page powered by Apache</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        This project has not only given my old MacBook a new purpose but also provided a centralized hub for my media and files, making it easier to access and manage my digital collections.
    </p>
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        When this project started, it was really just to see if I could make the movie server, but it has been a very fun experience and I have enjoyed working on it and adding features.
