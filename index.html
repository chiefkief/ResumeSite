        I have been working in assisted living for over two years now, with two different facilities. I was CBRF
certified from UW-Green Bay, which taught first aid in case of emergency's. we also learned Medication
Administration, which taught the procedures and the types of meds we pass. We also learned how to
handle resident behaviors, and techniques to reduce stress or anger. I believe that one of my greatest
strengths in Assisted Living was one on one cares, i really enjoy connecting with residents and helping
them with whatever they might need.

    <p>
        I was a Boy Scout for many years and have worked at Camp Phillips as an aquatics instructor and
        lifeguard. I have also worked with many different companies from food service to labor, and even a few
        communication based jobs. My father used to own a construction company, So I ended up working with
        him before I got into high school. From there, I ended up in a burger king, a papa murphys, a political
        call center and a boy scout camp, with random side jobs here and there.
